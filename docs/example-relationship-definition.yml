      # we have a predefined list of functions that you can call during synthesis which will help
      # you extract or transform the domainID attribute value into something you're expecting. 
      # as an example, take `hostExtractor` if your assigned domainID attribute value is
      # https://myhost.com/bla/bla then the hostExtractor will return myhost.com ignoring the rest
